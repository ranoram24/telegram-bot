# telegram-bot
 a telegram bot for saving URL

 basically a universial bookmark saver. you can save url and add them to categories (zoo videos,youtube videos while eating ext)

 the bot needs some work so its not final. the add function needs work and you cant really talk to him aside from the add pull and fact function


 to astublish the bot you need to go to telegram. search for 'botfather' and create a bot. when done copy the token and the username of the bot to the 'TOKEN' and 'BOT_USERNAME' varliables and you good to go!


the url you saves directs you to the original website!!! so a youtube url goes to youtube ext
